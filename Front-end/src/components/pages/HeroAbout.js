          <p>At Home Food, we know the value of a home-cooked meal.
           Every dish we create is made fresh off-site, with ingredients 
           sourced or harvested on the same day. We believe in slow cooking and meal-savoring - because good things take time.</p>
          <p>Now that times have changed, we must adapt. With our new concept,
          You can get food nearby location which is prepared within 10-15mins till you reach the destination point to take away.</p>
